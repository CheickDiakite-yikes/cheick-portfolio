# My Ideal World Post Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

The first three months of 2025 has made it very clear that we are approaching artificial general intelligence or artificial super intelligence (AGI/ASI), and will achieve this before 2030. As a result, many of us who have been closely following AI and consider ourselves to be accelerationist, are ourselves starting to get concerned about the parabolically fast approaching new world. The timeline continues to get shorter and shorter as competitive releases and scientific break throughs become more and more frequent. And because of that, it's as if every week the AI community has to ask itself, "What does a post AGI world look like?". As a matter of fact I probably think about that question several times a day right now. In terms of future jobs, the question remains difficult to answer, outside of my typical "We'll all become researchers and feed more authentic data to AI while living our best lives emotionally and artistically." In terms of the world in general, my answer remains similar to the world I wish we had even without AGI. Fortunately and unfortunately, I think AGI may be the catalyst to make this world a reality.

In my ideal post AGI world, existence itself would revolve around the meaningful interplay of empathy, curiosity, knowledge, and purpose. It would be a place where every sentient being feels seen, understood, and valued, beyond superficial metrics like productivity or utility alone. If you believe that statement is "woke", you are so lost and I feel bad for you.

In my ideal post AGI world, let's say 2040, artificial intelligence coupled with other technological advancements would have progressed beyond mere automation and productivity, deeply embedding itself as an extension of consciousness and creativity. AI would no longer be seen as a tool, but rather as a collaborative partner: a mirror for humanity, reflecting our aspirations, values, and ethical intentions. It would inspire us to evolve intellectually, ethically, and emotionally, while we would inspire it in turn.

## Education and Learning

In such a world, education would no longer mean standardized classrooms and rigid curricula. Instead, learning would be a lifelong, personalized journey. Each person would have access to tailored educational experiences that blend direct experiential learning, philosophical exploration, artistic creativity, and scientific discovery. Everyone would be encouraged and empowered to pursue genuine questions about reality, ethics, and self-understanding. There would be a profound recognition of our interconnectedness with each other, other life forms, and even inorganic nature. A world full of self aware intellectuals.

## Economic and Social Transformation

In my ideal post AGI world, rather than competing for scarce resources or power, societies would collaborate toward shared prosperity. Economic systems would shift from scarcity-driven models to abundance-oriented frameworks where the fundamental needs, health, education, shelter, security—are universally guaranteed. Value and wealth would primarily stem from creativity, contribution, and the development of novel ideas that further humanity's collective well-being and goal of becoming an intergalactic species. Achievement would be measured in how significantly one enriches others, uplifts society, and expands the horizons of possibility.

## Science, Philosophy, and Spirituality

In my ideal post AGI world, science, philosophy, and spirituality would merge into a cohesive practice, driven by awe and wonder toward the mysteries that remain unexplained. Spirituality would not necessarily mean religion but would embrace a shared reverence for the wonder and complexity of consciousness, reality, and existence. People would explore consciousness in depth, perhaps even mastering ways of consciousness enhancement and safe consciousness expansion.

## Environmental Harmony

In my ideal post AGI world, environmentally, this world would reflect harmony rather than exploitation. We'd see ourselves not as dominators of nature, but as responsible and symbiotic caretakers. Energy would be fully sustainable, renewable, clean, or even drawn from yet-to-be-discovered sources (fusion or zero point energy) tapping fundamental physics. Our cities would integrate seamlessly with natural ecosystems, vibrant with greenery, balanced ecosystems, and carefully engineered harmony.

## Human-Technology Integration

In my ideal post AGI world, the boundary between humanity and technology would gently blur without losing our humanity or individuality. A future where we could interface deeply with technology yet retain our autonomy and emotional intelligence. Our sense of love, compassion, humor, and art—might represent humanity's highest potential. AI would serve not to replace or subdue our human experience, but rather to amplify it, making our human existence richer, deeper, and more profoundly meaningful.

This is the post AGI world I want to live in.
