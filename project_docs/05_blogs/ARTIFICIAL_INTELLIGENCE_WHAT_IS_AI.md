# Artificial Intelligence: What Is AI And Where Are We With It?

It was early September, summer was coming to an end, I had just left Banking for Private Equity and one of the main things on my mind was what Artificial Intelligence (AI) is about to do to the world. Since the release of GPT-3.5 earlier this year, I have been using AI regularly, almost every day. I became obsessed with it and I wanted to know everything about it. What it could do, what it will do, everything. Every week I found myself on some reddit thread trying to find the next AI hack.

As this obsession started taking over, I continued following more and more reddit communities and other forums to keep up with the rapid developments. This obsession put me in a bubble where I thought everyone knew about AI and everyone is just as excited and worried about it as me. That was true around some of my peers in Boston, but then I visited some friends in Vermont and Connecticut and quickly realized I needed to write this article. Every single person in the world who is capable of doing so, should be learning and familiarizing themselves with AI urgently. It is your duty; you cannot get left behind and you cannot let this change happen without you.

Throughout human history, few topics have captured our collective imagination as intensely as artificial intelligence. From ancient myths of automatons to modern-day machine learning algorithms, the journey of AI is a testament to humanity's relentless pursuit of knowledge and innovation. But what is AI and where exactly are we on this journey?

## Demystifying Artificial Intelligence

### The Essence of AI

At its core, artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science dedicated to creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.

One of the most profound manifestations of AI in recent years is in the realm of natural language processing and that is Language Learning Models (LLM). Language Learning Models stand out as the digital linguists, bridging the communication gap between humans and machines. These sophisticated algorithms are designed to understand, generate, and interact using human language. By processing vast amounts of textual data, they learn the intricacies of language, from syntax and semantics to context and nuance. Models like OpenAI's GPT series or Google's BERT / BARD have revolutionized our interactions with technology, enabling machines to generate human-like text, translate languages with remarkable precision, assist in creative tasks like coding, and even automate everyday tasks like sending and responding to emails.

### The Underlying Power: Data

It's often said that data is the new oil, and in the world of AI, this holds true. AI, especially machine learning models, thrive on data. The more data they're fed, the better they perform. This is why even though data miners and marketers can be evil, our digital interactions from online shopping to social media browsing, play a crucial role in refining and enhancing AI models. The survival of humans and our planet literally depends on data. Especially valuable data like textbooks, research papers, etc. It's a symbiotic relationship: we provide the data, and in return, AI offers us new ideas, insights, knowledge, convenience, personalization, and different perspectives.

In essence, Artificial intelligence is a mirror reflecting our aspirations, capabilities, and creativity. As we continue to innovate and push the boundaries of what's possible, AI stands as a testament to human ingenuity, a tool that amplifies our potential and reshapes our world.

## A Brief History of AI

### Early Beginnings

The dream of creating machines that can think and act like humans dates back to ancient civilizations. The Greeks told tales of Hephaestus, the god of fire, crafting mechanical servants, and the Chinese had legends of automatons serving tea. Fast forward to the 20th century, and we find the birth of formal AI research. In the 1950s, Alan Turing posed the provocative question, "Can machines think?" His Turing Test became a foundational concept, setting the stage for decades of AI exploration.

### The AI Winter

The initial excitement around AI led to bold predictions. Some believed that within a few decades, machines would surpass human intelligence. However, the complexity of human cognition proved challenging to replicate. By the 1970s and 1980s, the initial optimism waned due to technical limitations and reduced funding. This period, often referred to as the "AI Winter," was a time of stagnation and skepticism.

### The Modern Resurgence

But like spring after winter, AI experienced a renaissance. The 21st century brought about significant advancements in computational power, data availability, and algorithmic innovations. Projects like IBM's Deep Blue defeating world chess champion Garry Kasparov (1997) and Google's AlphaGo besting Go champion Lee Sedol (2016) were not just victories for machines but for human ingenuity. These milestones rekindled the world's fascination with AI.
